8 ¹ H YPERION.

Is emptied ol thy hoery majesty.

Thy thunder, conscious ol the new command,

Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house;

And thy sherp lightning in unpradtis’d hands

Scorches ond bums our once serene domuin.

Ο aching time, O moments big as years!

All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth,

And pressit so upon our weeuy gn‘efs,

That unbeliel has not a space to brenthe.

Sam, sleep on :-O thoughtless‚ why did I

Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude?

Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes?

Satum‚ sleep onl while at thy feet I weep.”
As when, upon a trenced summer-night,

Those green-robed senators of mighty woods‚

Tall oaks, branchcharmed by the earnest stam,

Dream, and so dream all night without a stit,

Save from one gradusl solitary gust -

Which comes upon the silence, and dies off,

As it the ebbing eir had but one wave3

So came these words and went: the while in tears

She touch’d her sair large lorehead to the ground, 80

Just where her falling hair might be outspread
