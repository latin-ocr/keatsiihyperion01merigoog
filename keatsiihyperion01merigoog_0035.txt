22 H YPERIOM

¹ And diamond-paved, lustrous, long arcades, 220
Until he reached the great main cupola
There standing fierce beneath, he stamp'd his foot, ,
And from the basements deep to the high towers
Jan'd his own golden region: and before
The quavering thunder thereupon had ceased,
His· voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb,
To this result: “O dreams of day and night!
0 monstrous forms, O effigies of pain!

 

0 spettres busy in a cold, cold gloomt
Ο lank-ear’d phantoms of black-weeded pools! ²30

Why do 1 know ye? why have Ι seen ye? why

Is my eternal essence thus distraught‚

To see and to behold these horrors new?
Saturn is fallen, am 1 too to fall?

Am I to leaye this haven os my rest,

rhis cradle of my glory, this soft clime‚
This calm luxuriance of blissful light,

These crystalline pavilions, and pure sanes
Of all my lucent Empire? Itis lest
Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine.

The blaze, the splendour‚ and the symmetry‚
1 cannot see, but darkness, death and darkness.
