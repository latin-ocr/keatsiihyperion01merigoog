He breathed fierce breath against the sleepy portals,

Cleared them of heavy vapours, burst them wide
Suddenly on the ocean’s chilly streams.
The planet-orb of fire whereon he rode
Each day from east to west the heavens through, 270
Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds;
Not therefore veiled quite, blindsold and hid;
But ever and anon the glancing spheres,
Circles and arcs, and broad-belting colore, ·
Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark
Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep
Up to the zenith 3 hieroglyphics old,
Which sages and keen-eyed astrologers
Then living on the earth, with labouring thought
Won from the gaze of many centuries: 280
Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge
Os stone or marble swart 3 their import gone,
Their wisdom long since fled. Two wings this orb 1
Possess’d for glory, two fair argent wings, ¹
Ever exalted at the God’s approach:
And now from forth the gloom their plumes immense
Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were3

While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse,
