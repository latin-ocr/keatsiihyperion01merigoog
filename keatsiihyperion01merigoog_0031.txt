18 Hypanront

Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp3

But horrors, portion'd to a giant’s nerve‚

Oft made Hypen'on aehe. His palaee bright

Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold,

And touch’d with shade ο1 bronzed obelisks,

Glared a blood-red through all its thousand courts,
Arches and domes, and fiery galleries: 180¹
And all its curtains ο1 Aurorian clouds

Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagles' wings‚

Unseen before by Gods or wondering men,

Darken'd the place3 and neighing steeds were heard,
Not heard before by Gods or wondering men.
Also when he would taste the spicy wreaths

01 incense, hreathed'aloft from sacred hills,

Instead os sweets his ample palate took

Savour of poisonous brass, and metal sich.

And sn, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, 190
After the full completion of fair day,

For rest divine upon exalted couch,

And slumber in the anns of melody,

He paced away the pleasant hours of ease

With stride colossal on from hall to hall ς

While lar within each aisle and deep recess
