44 HYPERJOM

Thick night consounds the pine-tops with the clouds: 80
And many else, whose names may not be told.

For when the Muse's wings are air-ward spread,
Who shall delay her ssight? And she must chant

Of Saturn and his guide, who now had climb'd
With damp and slippery footing from a depth
More horrid stin. Above a sombre cliff

Their heads appear'd, and up their stature grew,
Till on the level height their steps found ease.

Then Thea'spread abroad her trembling arms

Upon the precindts of this nest of pain,

And sidelong fixed her eye on Saturn's facet
There saw she direst strife 3 the supreme God
At war with all the frailty os grief,

Of rage, os sear, anxiety, revenge‚

Remorse, spleen, hope, but most of all despair.
Against these plagues he strove in vain3 sor Fate
Had pour’d a mortal oil upon his head,

A disanointing poison: so that Thea,

Affrighted, kept her still, and let him pass

First onwards in, among the fallen tribe. 100

As with us mortal men, the laden heart
