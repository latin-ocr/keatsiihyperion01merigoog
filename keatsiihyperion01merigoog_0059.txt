46 HYPERJOM

Is persecuted more, and fever’d more,
When it is nighing to the mournful house
Where other heerts are sick of the same bruise 3
So Satum, as he walk'd into the midst‚
Felt faint, and would have sunk among the rest,
But that he met Enceladus's eye,
Whose mightiness, -and owe of him, at once
Came like an inspiration ; and he shouted,
“ TitanS, behold your God ! ’³ at which some groan’d ; 110
. Some started on their feet 3 some also shouted;
Some wept, some wail’d; all bow'd with reverence:
And OpS, uplisting her black folded veil,
Showd her pale cheeks, and all her forehead wan,
Her eyebrows thin and jet, and hollow eyes.

There is a roaring in the bleak-grown pines

When winter lifts his voice3 there is a noise

Among immortals, when a God gives sign,

With hushing finger, how he means to load

His tongue with the full weight of utterless thought, 120
With thunder, and with music, and with pomp:

Such noise is like the roar of bleakgrown pines;

Which, when it eeases in this mountain’d world,

No other sound succeeds; but ceasing here,
