54 HYPERIOM

Was ripening in itself. The ripe hour came,

And with it Light‚ and Light engendering

Upon its own producet, sorthwith touch'd

The whole enonnous matter into lise

Upon that very bour, our panentege

The Heavens and the Easth were manifest:

Then thou first-born, end we the ginnt tace, 200
Found ourselves ruling new and beauteous renims.
Now comes the pain of nuth, to whom ’tis paint
Ο folly! for to bear ali naked nothe,

And to envisage circumstance, all caim,

This is the top os sovereignty. Mark well!

As Heaven and Esirth ate fuirer, fairer sar

Than Chaos and blank Darkness‚ though once chiefs;
And as we show beyond that Heaven and Easth
In form and shape, compa& end beautiful,

In will, in action free, companionship,

And thousand other signs of purer lise ;

So on our heels a fresh- perfection treads,

A power more strong in beauty, born of us

And fated to excel us, as we pass

In glory that old Darkness: norece we

Thereby more conquei'd than by us the rule
