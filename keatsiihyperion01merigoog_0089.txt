7⁶ HYPERIOM

In aid soft marble from the Dorian flute ς
For lo! ’tis for the Father os all verse.

Flush everything that hath a venneil hue,
Let the rose glow intense and warm the air,

And let the clouds of e'ven andos mom

Float in voluptuous fleeces 0'er the hills3 ·
Let the red wine within the goblet boil,

Cold as a bubbling well; let faint-lipp’d shells‚

On sands, or in great deeps, vermilion turn 20
Through all their labyrinths 3 and let the maid
Blush keenly, as with some warm kiss surpris'd.
Chief island os the embower'd Cyclades,

Rejoice, O Delos, with thine olives green,

And poplars, and lawn-shading palms, and beech
In which the Zephyr breathes the loudest song,
And hazels thick, dark-stemm'd beneath the shade:
Apollo is once more the golden theme!

Where was he when the Giant os the Sun

Stood bright amid the sorrow os his peers? 30
Together had he left his mother fair

And his twinsister sleeping in their bower,
And in the morning twilight wanderd forth
Beside the osiers os a n‘vulet,
