10 Η YPERION.

A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet

One moon, with alteration slow, had shed
Her silver seasons four upon the night,
And still ,these two were postured motionless‚
Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern;
The frozen God still couchant on the earth,
And the sad Goddess weeping athis feet:
Until at length old Satum lifted up
His saded eyes, and 'saw his kingdom gone,
And all the gloom and sorrow of the place,
And that fair kneeling Goddess ; end then spake
As with a palsied tongne, and while his beard
Shook horrid with such aspen-malady.

“ Ο tender spouse of gold 'Hyperion

Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face ;

Look up, and let me see our doom in it 3

Look up, and tell me if this seeble shape

Is Saturn’s3 tell me, if thou hear’st the voice
os satum ; ten me, nnis wnnkling now, 100 l
Naked and bare of its great diadem,
Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power

To make me desolate? whence came the strength?
How was it nurtured to such bursting forth,
