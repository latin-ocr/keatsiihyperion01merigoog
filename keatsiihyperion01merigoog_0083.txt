70 HYPERJOM

He press’d together, and in silence stood.
Despondence seized again the fallen Gods

At sight of the dejected King of Day,

And many hid their faces from the light:

But fierce Enceladus sent forth his eyes

Among the brotherhood; and, at their glare,
Uprose Iapetus and Creiis too,

And Phorcus, sea-born, and together strode

To where he toweffd on his eminence.

There those four shouted forth old Saturn's name:
Hyperion from the peak loud answered, “Saturni'’
Saturn sate near the Mother of the Gods,

In whose face was no joy, though all the Gods 390
Gave from their hollow throats the name os “Satum !’'
