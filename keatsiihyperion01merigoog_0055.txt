42' HYPERJOM

Palm-shaded templeS, and high rival sanes

By Oxus, or in Ganges’ sacred isles.

Even as Hope upon her anchor leans,

So leant she, not so fair, upon a tusk

Shed from the broadest os her elephants.

Above her, on a crag's uneasy shelf,

Upon his elbow rais’d, all prostrate else,
Shadow’d Enceladus 3 once tame and mild,

As grazing ox unworried in the meads 3

Now tiger-passion’d, lion-thoughted, wroth,

He meditated, plotted, and even now

Was hurling mountains in that second war, ¹ 70
Not long delay’d, that seared the younger Gods
To hide themselves in forms of beast and bird.
Not far hence Atlas 3 and beside him prone
Phorcus, the sire of Gorgons. Neighbour’d close
Oceanus, and Tethys, in whose lap

Sobb’d Clymene among her tangled hair.

In midst of all lay Themis at the feet

Of Ops the queen all clouded round from sight 3

No shape distinguishable, more than when
