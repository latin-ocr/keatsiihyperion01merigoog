82 H YPERION.

With sudden scrutiny and gloomless eyes, 80
Thus answer’d‚ while his white melodious throat

Throbb'd with the syllables :—“ Mnemosyne!
Thy name is on my tongue‚ Ι know not how ;
Why should Ι tell thee what thou so well seest?
Why should I strive to show what from thy lips
Would come no mystery? For me, dark, darh,
And painful vile oblivion seals my eyes:

I strive to search wherefore I am so sad,

Ι Until a melancholy numbs my limbs 3

And then upon the grass I sit, and moan, 90
Like one who once had wings—O why should I

Feel cursed and thwarted when the liegeless air

Yields to my step aspirant? Why should I

Spurn the green turf as hateful to my feet?

Goddess benign, point out some unknown thing:

Are there not other regions than this isle?

What are the stars? There is the Sun, the Sunt

And the most patient brilliance of the Moon!

And stars by thousandsl Point me out the way

To any one particular beauteous star, 100

And Ι will flit into it with my lyre,
