32 rrrprrrroar

In men who die. This is the grief, Ο Son!
Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay and fall!

Yet do thou strive 5 as thou art capable,

As thou canst move about, an evident God,
And canst oppose to each malignant hour
Ethereal presence. Ι am but a voice 3

My life is but the life of winds and tides;

No more than winds and tides can I avail:
But thou canst. Be thou therefore in the van
Of circumstance ; yea, seize the 'arrow’s barb
Before the tense string murmur. To the Earth!
For there thou wilt find Satum and his woes.
Meantime I will keep watch on thy bright sun,

And of thy seasons be a careful hurseJ'

Ere half this region-whisper had come down
Hyperion arose, and on the stars 350
Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide
Until it ceased 3 and still he kept thern wide,

And still they were the same bright patient stars.
Then with a slow incline of his broad breast,
Like to a diver in the pearly seas,

Forward he stoop’d over the airy shore,

And plunged all noiseless into the deep night
