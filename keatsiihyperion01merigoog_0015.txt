HYPERION

BOOK THE FJRST.

3 ’ ’ in the shady sadness os a vale

'v 41* at Far sunken from the healthy breath os morn,
Far from the fiery noon, and eve’s one star,

Sate grey-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone,

Still as the silence roundabout his lair 3

Forest on forest hung about his head ’

Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there,

Not so much life as on a summer's day

Robs not one light seed from the feather’d grass 3

But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. 10

Α stream went voieeless by, still deaden'd more

By reason of his fallen divinity
