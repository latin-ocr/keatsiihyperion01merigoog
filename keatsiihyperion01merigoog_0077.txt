“Or shall we listen to the over-wise,
Or to the over-soolish giant, Gods?¹
Not thunderbolt on thunderbolu till all
That rebel Jove’s whole armoury were spent,
Not world on world upon these shoulders piled,
Could agonizo me more thau huby-words
In midst of this dethronement horriblo
Speukl roar! shoutl yelll ye sleepy 'h'tans 111
Do ye forget the blows, the buffets vile?
Are ye not smitten by a youngling ann?
Dost thou forget, sham monarch of the waves,

. Thy sculding iu the seas? What! have I roused 320

Your spleens with so few simple words as these?
O joy! sor now I see ye are not lost:
Ο joy! sor now I see a thousand eyes
Widoglaring for revenge.”—As this he said,

He listed up his stature vast, and stood,
. Still without intermission speaking thus:

“Now γε are flames, I’ll tell you how to bum,
And purge the ether os our enemies 3
How to seed fierce the crooked stiugs of fire,
And singe away the swollen clouds of Jove, 330
Stiffing that puny essence in his tent. -
