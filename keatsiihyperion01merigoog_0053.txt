When the 'chih rain begins at shut of eve

In dull November, and their chancelvault,

The heaven itself‚ is blinded throughout night
Each one kept shroud‚ nor to his neighbour gave
Or word, or look, or aetion of despair.

Creiis was one 3 his ponderous iron mace

Lay by him, and a shatter'd rib of roclr

Told of his rege, ere he thus sank and pined.
Iapetus another 3 in his grasp

A serpent’s plashy neck ; its barbed tongue
Squeezed from the gorge, and all its uncurl'd length
Dead3 and because the creature could not spit
lts poison in the eyes of conquering Jove.

As though in pain3 sor still upon the flint 50
He ground severe his skull, with open mouth '

And eyes at horn'd working. Nearest him ·
Asia, born of most enonnous Car,

Who eost her mother Tellus keener pangs,
Though feminine, than any os her sons=

More thought than voe was in her dusky face,
For she was prophesying of her glory 3

And in hervide imagination stood
