Sorrow morebeautiful than Beautsfs sels.

There was a listening sear in her regard,
As if calamity had but begun;
As if the vanward clouds os evil days
Had spent their malim, and the sullen rear 40
Was with its stored thunder labouring up. '
One hand she press’d upon that aching part
Where beats the human beart, as if just there,
Though an· immortal, she felt cruel pain:
The other upon Satum’s bended neck
She laid, and to the level os his ear
Leaning with parted lips, some words she spahe
In solemn tenour, and deep organ tone:
Some mouming words, which in our feeble tongue
Would come in these-like accents: Ο how frsr‘l 30
To that large utterance of the early Gods!
“Satum‚ look up! though wherefore, poor old king!
I have no comfort for thee, no, not one:
I cannot say, ‘O wherefore sleepest thout'

For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth
Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God 3

And ocean too, with all its solemn noise,
Has from thy seeptre past, and all the air
