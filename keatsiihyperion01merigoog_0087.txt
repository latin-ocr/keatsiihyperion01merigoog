BOOK THE THIRD.

lHUSIT in alternate uproar and sad peace

3( {7³¹ Amazed were those Titans utterly.

ἰ ’ἵ O leave them, Musel Ο leave them to their
woesl

For thou art weak to sing such tumults dire:

A solitary sorrow best befits

Thy lips, and antheming a lonely grief.

Leave them, O Musel for thou anon wilt find

Many a fallen old Divinity

Wandering in vain about bewildevd shorea

Meantime touch piously the Delphic haxp, 10

And not a wind of heaven but will breathe
