20 . HYPERIOM

His winged minions in close clusters stood,
Amazed and *full of sear ; like anxious men,
Who on wide plains gather in panting troops,
When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. 200
Even now, while Saturn‚ roused from icy nance,
Went step sor step with Thea through the woods‚
Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear,
Came slope upon the threshold of the west:
Then, as was wont, his palace-doors flew ope
In smoothed silence, save what solemn tubes
Blown by the serious Zephyrs gave of sweet
And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies:
And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape,
In lragrance soit and coolness to the eye, 210
That inlet to severe magnificence
stood full-blm, lor the God to enter in
He entend, but he entei’d full of wrath 3

His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels,

And gave a mar, as if of earthly fire,

That scared away the meek ethereal Hours,

And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared,
From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault,
Tlnough nowers of lragrwt and inwreathed light,
