80 H YPERION.

These grassy solitudes, and seen the flowers

Lift up their heads, as still the whisper pass'd.
Goddess! I have beheld those eyes before,

And their etemal calm, and all that face, 60 ¹
Or 1 have dreamed.'''-“Yes‚” said the supreme shape‚

‘⁴ Thou hast dream'd of me, and awaking up

Didst find a lyre all golden by thy side,

Whose stn'ngs touch’d by thy fingens, all the vast
Unwearied ear of thewhole universe

Listen’d in pain and pleasure at the birth

Of such new tuneful wonder. Is't not strange

That thou should’st weep so gifted? Tell me, youth,
What sorrow thou canst feel, for I am sad

When thou dost shed a tear: explain thy griefs 70
To one who in this lonely isle hath been

The watcher of thy sleep and hours of life,

From the young day when first thy infant hand
Pluck’d witless the weak flowen, till thine arm
Could bend that bow heroic to all times.

Show thy heart's secret to an ancient Power

Who hath forsaken old and sacred thrones

For prophecies of thee, and for the sake

Of loveliness new-born.'’--Apollo, then,
