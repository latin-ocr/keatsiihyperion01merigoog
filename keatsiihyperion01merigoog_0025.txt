12 HYPERIOM

While fate seem’d strangled in my nervous graspt
But it is so 3 and I am smotheffd up,

And buried from all god-like exercise

Of influence benign on planets pale,

Of admonitions to the winds and sees,

Of peaceful sway above man’s harvesting, 110
Of all those acts which Deity supreme

Doth ease its heart of love in. Ι am gone
Away from my own bosom 3 1 have lest .
My strong identity‚ my real sels,

Somewhere between the throne, and where 1 sit
Here on this spot of earth. Search‚ Thea, search
Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round
Upon all space 3 space starr'd‚ and lom of light3
Space region’d with life-air, and barren void 3
Spaces of fire, and all the yawn os hell. 120
Search, Thea, search! and tell me if thou seest
Α certain shape or shadow‚ making way

With wings or chariot fierce, to repossess

A heaven he lost erewhile: it must, it must

Be of ripe progress: Satum must be king!

iles there must be a golden victory 3

There must be gods thrown down, and trumpets blown
