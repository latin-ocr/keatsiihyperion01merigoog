60 H YPERION.

Where a sweet clime was breathed from a land
of fragrance, quietness and trees and flowers.

Full of calm joys it was, as Ι of grief ;

Τοο full os joy and sost delicious warmth ς

So that Ι felt a movement in my heart

To chide and to reproach that solitude

With songs of mise1y‚ music of our woes 3

And sate me down, and took a mouthed shell 270
And murmqu into it, and made melody-

O melody no more! for while I sang,

And with poor skill let pass into the breeze
The dull shell's echo, from a bowery strand
Just opposite, and island οἸ the sea,

There came enchantment with the shifting wind,
That did both drown and keep alive mine ears
Ι threw my shell away upon the sand,

And a wave fill’d it, as my sense was fill’d
With that new blissful golden melody.

A living death wastin each gush os sounds,
Each family of rapturous hum'ed notes, .
That fell one aster one, yet all at once,

Like pearl-beads dropping sudden from their string:
And then another, then another strain,
