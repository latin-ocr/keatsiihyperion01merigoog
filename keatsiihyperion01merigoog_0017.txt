4 Hrrsnrow.

Spreading a shade: the Naiad ’mid her reeds
Press’d her cold finger closer to her lips.
Along the margin-send large footmarks went,
No farther than to where his feet had stray’d,
And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground
His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, ’

Unsceptred3 and his realmless eyes were closed 3 ⁸
While his bow'd head seem'd listening to the Earth, 20 g
His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.

It seem'd* no force could wake him from his place ;
But there carne one, 'who with a kindred hand
Touch'd his wide shouldem, aster bending low
With reverence, though to one who knew it not.

She was a Goddess os the infant world 3

By her in stature the tall Amazon

Had stood a pigmy’s height: she would have ta’en
Achilles hythe hair and bent his neck;

Or with a finger stawd Ixion's wheel. - 30
Her face was large as that of Memphian Sphinx,
Pedestal'd haply in a palam-court,

When sages look'd to Egypt sor their lore,

But ohl how unlike marble was that face:

How beautiful! if sorrow had not made
