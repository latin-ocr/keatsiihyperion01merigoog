Which met at thy creating! at whose joys
And palpitations sweet and pleasures soft,
I Coelus wonder how they came and whence 3

And at the fruits thereos what shapes they be,
Distinet and visible ; symbols divine,

Manifestations of that beauteous life

Diffused unseen throughout eternal space 3

Of these new-form'd art thou, Ο brightest child!

Of these thy brethren and the goddesses. 320
There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion

Oi son against his sire. I saw him fall,

I saw my first-bom tumbled from his throne!

To me his arms were spread, to me his voice

Found way from forth the thunders round his head!
Pale wox Ι, and in vapours hid my iace.

Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is:
For Ι have seen my sons most unlike' Gods.

Divine ye were created, and divine

In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, 330
Unruffled‚ like high GodS, ye lived and ruled:

Now I behold in you sear, hope, and wrath ;
Aetions of rage and passion3 even as

I see them iu the mortal world beneath‚
