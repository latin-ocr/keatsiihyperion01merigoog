16 H YPERION.

O Saltum, come away, and give them heart 3
I know the covert‚ for thence came 1 hither.''

Thus biief3 then with beseeching eyes she went
With backward footing through the shade a space:
He follow’d, and she turned to lead the way
Through aged boughs‚ that yielded like the mist ’
Which eagles cleave, upmountingsrom their nest.

Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed‚
More sorrow like to this, and such like woe,
Too huge for mortal tongoe‚ or pen of scn'be 160
The Titans fierce, sels-hid or prison·bound,
Groan'd for the old allegiance once more,
And listen’d in sharp pain sor Satum’s voice.
But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept
His sovereignty and mle and majesty.
Blazing Hyperion on his orbed tire
Still sate, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up
From man to the sun’s God‚ yet unsecure:
For as among us mortals omens drear
Fright and perplex, so also shuddei'd he ; 170
Not et dog’s howl‚ or gloom-bird’s hated screech‚
Or the familiar visiting of one
Upon the first toll of the passing-bell,
