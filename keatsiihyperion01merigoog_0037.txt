²4 H YPERION.

Even here, into my centre of repose‚

The shady visions corneto domineer‚

Insult and blind, and stifle up my pomp.

Fall! no, by Tellus and her briny robes!

Over the fiery frontier os my realms

1 will advance a terrible right arm

Shall scare that infant Thunderer, rebel Jove,

And bid old Satum take his throne again.’' 250
He spake and ceased, the while a heavier threat

Held struggle with his· throat, but came not forth:

For as in theatres of crowded men

Hubbub increases more they call out “ Hush!” O

So at Hyperion's words the phantoms pale
Bestirr'd themselves, thriee horrible and cold ;
And from the mimor'd level where he stood

A mist arose, as from a seummy marsh.

ι At this through all his bulk an agony

Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown‚ ' 260
Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular,

1 Making slow way, with head and neck convuls’d
With over-strained might. Releas’d he fled

To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours
Before the dawn in season due should blush,
