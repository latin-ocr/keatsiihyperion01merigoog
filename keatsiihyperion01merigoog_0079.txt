0 let him feel the evil he bath done:

For, though I scorn Oceanus's lore,

Much pain have 1 for more than loss of renlms:
'Ihe days of peace and slumberous calm are fled3
Those days, sil innocent oi scathing war,

When all the sair Existences oi heaven

Came openeyed to guess what we would speak :—
That was before our brows were taught to frown,
Before our lips knew else but solemn sounds ; 340
That was before we knew the winged thing,
Vitiory, might be lost, or might be won.

And be ye mindful that Hyperion,

Our brightest brother, still is undisgraeede·

Hyperion, lot his radiance is herei”
All eyes were on Enceladus's sace,
And they beheld, while still Hyperion’s name
Flew from his lips up to the vaulted rocks,
Α pallid gleam across his features stern:
Not savage, sor he saw full many a God 350
Wroth as himself. He look’d upon them all,
And in each face he saw a gleam os light,
lint splendider in Saturn’s, whose boar locks
Sirone like the bubbling foam about a keel,
