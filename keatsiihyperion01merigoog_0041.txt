28 H YPERION.

Awaiting for Hyperion's command.
Fain would he have commanded, sain took throne, 290
And bid the day begin, if but for change.
He might not ; no, though a primeval God:
The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd.
Theresore the operations of the dawn
Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told
Those silver wings expanded sisterly,
Eager to sail their orb3 the porches wide
Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of the night;
And the bright Titan, frenzied with new woes,
Unused to bend, by hard compulsion bent 300
His spirit to the sorrow of the time:
And all along a dismal rack of clouds,
Upon the boundaries of day and night,
He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint.
There, as he lay, the Heaven with its stars
Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice

Of Coelus, from the universal space,

Thus whisper’d low and solemn in his ear.

“O brightest of my children dear, earth-born
And sky-engender’d, Son of mysteries
All unrevealed even to the Powers
