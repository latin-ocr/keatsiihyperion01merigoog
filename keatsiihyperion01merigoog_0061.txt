Among these fallen, Saturn's voice therefore
Grew up, like organ, that begins anew

Its strain, when other harmonios, stopt short,

Leave the dinn’d air vibrating silverly.

Which is its own great judge and searcher out, r 30
Can I find reason why ye should be thus:

Not in the legends of the first of days,

Studied from that old spirit-leaved book,

Which starry Uranus with finger bright

Saved from the shores of darkness, when the waves
Low-ebb’d still hid it up in shallow gloom;

And the which book ye know 1 ever kept

For my firm-based footstool :—ah, infirm!

Not there, nor in sign, symbol, or portent

Oi clement, earth, water, air or fite,-

At war, or peace, or inter-quarrelling

One against one, or two, or three, or all

Each several one against the other three,

As fire with air loud-warring, when rain-lioods
Drown both, and press them both against earth’s iace,
Where, finding sulphur, a quadruple wrath

Unhinges the poor world 3-not in that suile,
