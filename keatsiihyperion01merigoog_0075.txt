Each like a dove, leaving its olive-perch,
· With music wingd instead ol silent plumes,
To hover round my head, and make me sick
of joy aud grief at once. Grief overcame‚
And Ι was stopping up my frantie ears, ²90
When, past all hindrance of my trembling hands,
A voice came sveeter‚ sweeter than all tune,
And still it cried‚ ‘Apollol young Apollol’

‘The morning bright Apollo l' ‘young Apollo !'
I fled3 it follow'd me, and cried‚‘Apollol’
O Father and Ο Brethren, had ye felt

Those pains of minel 0' satum, hadst thou felt,

Ye would not call this too indulged tongue

Presumptuous‚ in thus venturing to he heard''
So far her voice flov’d on, like timorous brook 300

That lingering along a pebbled coast

Doth sear to meet the sea: but sea it met

And shuddefld ; for the overvhelming voice

Os huge Enceladus swallow'd lt in wrath:

The ponderous syllables, like sullen wavcs

In the hals-glutted hollows of ress-rocks,

Came booming thus, while still upon his arm

He leant not rising from supreme contempt
